# Welcome to the 3748 Swerve Code Docs!
---
This repository contains code developed by Ragnorok Robotics for the WCP swerve modules and a custom chassis(although it can be applied to any set up with tweaking).

It integrates [Pathplanner](auto.md) for easy auto-routine design, and [AdvantageKit/AdvantageScope](logging.md) for logging and debugging. 

This code is part of [the 2024 competition code](https://github.com/frc3748/2024-Robot-Code)
