# Welcome to the 3748 Swerve Code Docs!
---
This repository contains code developed by Ragnorok Robotics for the WCP swerve modules and a custom chassis(although it can be applied to any set up with tweaking).

It integrates [Pathplanner](auto.md) for easy auto-routine design, and [AdvantageKit/AdvantageScope](logging.md) for logging and debugging. 

Code can be found in the [Offseason Swerve Repository](https://github.com/frc3748/Offseason-Swerve)

## Components of the swerve code

- [Swerve Math](swerveMath.md)
- [Drivetrain Subsystem](drivetrainSubsystem.md)
- [Logging Workflow](logging.md)
- [Auto Workflow](auto.md)
